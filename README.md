# Golang Websockets Front-End Starter Project (Chat App)

- I'm not using any framework for the front end just pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Golang is being used to serve the 'web' directory which contains all our front-end code.
- The web socket portion of the app is using Gorilla Websockets (yay for them being maintained again!)


Front-End Code -> ```/web```

Backend Code -> ```*.go``` files

Run the project with:
```go run *.go```
